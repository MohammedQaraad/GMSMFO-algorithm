# GMSMFO-algorithm
Global Optimization and Intrusion Detection Using a Novel Gaussian Mutated and Shrink Moth Flame Optimization
The Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm is a meta-heuristic that generates solutions for optimization problems using the transverse orientation navigation technique of moths. The performance of MFO is dependent on the flame production and spiral search components. However, its search mechanism could still be improved in terms of the diversity of flames and the moths' ability to find solutions. A revised version, GMSMFO, has been developed to address this. GMSMFO uses a Novel Gaussian mutation mechanism and shrink MFO to enhance population diversity and balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. The performance of the proposed GMSMFO algorithm was tested using the CEC 2017 benchmark and 20 datasets, including high-dimensional and an intrusion detection system dataset. GMSMFO was compared to other cutting-edge meta-heuristics algorithms and evaluated using the Friedman and Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical tests. The results showed that GMSMFO is not only highly competitive but also frequently superior to the other algorithms. Additionally, the study found that GMSMFO can identify the ideal feature subset, leading to improved classification accuracy and reduced number of features used
